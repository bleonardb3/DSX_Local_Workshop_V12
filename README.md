# DSX Local Workshop V1.2
In this workshop you will learn how to develop and deploy applications in DSX Local. The workshop has been divided into several stand-alone parts for those who are interested in a certain development tool or a certain deployment task. 

## About this repository
This repository contains several lab subfolders. Some labs include notebooks and data, while others have additional instructions that are located in the *Lab Instructions* folder. 

## Prerequisites
1. Knowledge of analytics. These labs do not teach you the basics of analytics or how to implement analytics in R, Python and SPSS. The purpose of this workshop is to provide hands-on experience with analytics tools and deployment functions in DSX. 
2. To run this workshop you need an instance of DSX Local. 
3. Download the [DSX_Local_Workshop.zip](https://github.com/SidneyPhoon/DSX_Local_Workshop/blob/master/DSX%20Local%20Projects/DSX_Local_Workshop.zip?raw=true).

### Setting up lab projects in DSX Local
1. Rename the downloaded **DSX_Local_Workshop.zip** file and give it a unique name.  For example, add your initials.    *Note: Project names in DSX Local cluster must be unique. When we create a project "from file", the project name is inherited from the file name*.
2. Log in to DSX Local.
3. Select "Create New Project" and select "From File".
4. Browse to the .zip file and click **Create**.

### Lab 1: Build, Save and Test SparkML Models (Jupyter/Python)
1. Open the project you just created. 
2. Navigate to **Assets** view and open **TelcoChurn_SparkML** *Jupyter* notebook. This notebook has been implemented for the Python 2.7 runtime. You can verify the runtime by running the first cell in the notebook. 
3. Follow instructions in the notebook.

### Lab 2: Invoke Deployed Model Programmatically (Jupyter/Python)
1. Open the project you just created. 
2. Navigate to **Assets** view and open **TelcoChurn_Invoke_Deployed_Model** *Jupyter* notebook. 
3. Follow instructions in the notebook.

### Lab 3: Build, Save and Test Scikit-Learn Models (Jupyter/Python)
1. In your DSX_Local_Workshop Project, add the **CreditCardDefault_SkLearn** notebook from URL, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SidneyPhoon/DSX_Local_Workshop/master/Analytic_Assets/CreditCardDefault_SkLearn.jupyter.ipynb
![ProjectFromFile](/img/import_notebook_url.png?raw=true).
2. Follow instructions in the notebook.

### Lab 4: Build, Save and Test SparkML models (Zeppelin/Python)
1. In your DSX_Local_Workshop Project, add the **TelcoChurn_Zeppelin** note from URL, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SidneyPhoon/DSX_Local_Workshop/master/Analytic_Assets/TelcoChurn_Zeppelin.json 
![ProjectFromFile](/img/import_zeppelin_url.png?raw=true).
2. Follow instructions in the notebook.

### Lab 5: Build R models in Jupyter and deploy into Shiny App
1. Download the [DS_for_Automotive.zip](https://github.com/SidneyPhoon/DSX_Local_Workshop/blob/master/DSX%20Local%20Projects/DS_for_Automotive.zip?raw=true)
2.  Follow instructions in the **[R_in_DSX.pdf](https://github.com/SidneyPhoon/DSX_Local_Workshop/blob/master/Lab%20Instructions/R_in_DSX.pdf)**

### Lab 6: SPSS Modeler in DSX
